Welcome to HWToolkit (hwt) generated documentation!
=============================================

This documentation is automatically generated from actual source code.

HWToolkit (hwt) 

* Is toolkit where you can create object based hardware description in natural way and convert it to Verilog/VHDL/System C and pack it as IP-core.
* HWT also contains digital circuit simulator with UVM like verification environment.
* HWT is build as abstraction layer over all HDL languages
* HWT tries to be noob-user friendly (because hardware development is not an easy task...) but will not constrain you.
* Most of parts of HWT ecosystem are independent and you can use it separately (for example: Xilinx Vivado/Intel Quartus driver in hwtBuildsystem.*, VHDL/Verilog code generator in hwt.serializer.*). 


Take look at hwtLib where are many useful components.
There is hwtHls, High-Level Synthesis (HLS) framework (pre-alfa) build on top of hwt.
There is hwtIde, web based IDE and visualizer for this framework (pre-pre-alfa). 

Tutorial is in hwtLib.samples.*, every file in this module contains user-entry-level comments.
